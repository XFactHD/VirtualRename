# VirtualRename

VirtualRename is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin which allows "virtually" renaming parameters and local variables in read-only
files. This can for example be used to make method bodies in decompiled code more readable.\
The new names are overlayed on top of the original parameter/variable names and do not affect the actual file contents
